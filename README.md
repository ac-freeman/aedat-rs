# AEDAT

AEDAT is a fast AEDAT 4 Rust reader.

This project was forked from https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/aedat, to simply remove the Python hooks and to publish it as a crate. You can use this crate when building bespoke Rust software for processing DVS/DAVIS AEDAT4 files--e.g., networked vision systems or event compressors.

# Documentation

Refer to the [source project](https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/aedat) for some documentation, especially [src/lib.rs](https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/aedat/blob/master/src/lib.rs). Future work will focus on adding proper Cargo docs to the Rust code.
